# Hi

My name is **Daniel** and I am a **Software Engineer** from Germany.

I do JavaScript front-end and back-end engineering, application and API design and I am totally into databases,
especially PostgreSQL. I give software development trainings and teach database administration at university.

I work as a freelance engineer and also do [Open Source work](https://github.com/dak0rn).

I like Emacs. But I use vim.

Write me at <a href="mailto:daniel@suitsoft.eu">daniel@suitsoft.eu</a>.
