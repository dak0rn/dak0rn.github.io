The custom domain for this GitHub page is now online. [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) is
used to connect the top level domain to the GitHub subdomain.

In addition, Cloudflare is used to provide an SSL tunnel with a valid signed
EV certificate, speed optimizations and caching. A page rule is used to automatically
forward visitors to the HTTPS version.

## How to

Setting up a custom domain with Cloudflare is quite easy. Given you already have
a user page at `username.github.io` and a registered top level domain you just
have to do the following steps:

1. **Register a Cloudflare account** on [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com) and
configure your domain there. (I had to confirm that name servers have been changed
before I could actually change them in my domain management console)
2. **Change your domain settings** by changing your domain's name servers to the two
name servers provided by Cloudflare. I had to wait about 24 hours before the name
servers were updated.
3. **Configure your domain** on Cloudflare. I had to choose *Flexible SSL* to
setup a correct encrypted connection.
4. **Add a page rule** to forward your visitors to SSL. Open the Page Rules site,
add the URL `*yourdomain.tld*` and choose *Always use HTTPS* ([see here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168306-Is-there-a-tutorial-for-Page-Rules-)).
5. **Configure your repo** by adding a file named `CNAME` that contains only
the top level domain ([see here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/)).
