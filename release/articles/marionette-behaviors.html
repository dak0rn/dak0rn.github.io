<p><a href="http://marionettejs.com">Marionette</a> comes with a very handy feature named <strong>Behavior</strong>s that
helps you to write DRY views by moving repetetive parts to a separate module. It allows you to
write reusable components without creating heavy-weight parent classes. Behaviors are comparable with
mixins or interfaces known from other languages and can be integrated in existing code with minor changes.</p>
<p>When developing web applications I often use a fade over effect between views when navigating to another
page. The idea is quite simple: the view hides itself if it gets rendered (<code>onRender</code>) and can then be
made visible using the triggered methods <code>fade:in</code> and <code>fade:out</code> that use promises to tell other parts
when the animation has finished.</p>
<p>While its quite easy to implement the code for these three concepts has to be written in every view that
wants to use it - including complex views, custom views and layouts. All in all, that is not very dry.</p>
<h2 id="marionette-behaviors">Marionette behaviors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Behavior components extend <code>Marionette.Behavior</code>.</li>
<li>They have default values (in <code>.defaults</code>) and can have an <code>events</code> hash (using the view&#39;s <code>ui</code> property).</li>
<li>Events emitted by <code>triggerMethod()</code> are given to the behavior when triggered on the view and the methods <code>initialize</code>, <code>onRender</code>, <code>onBeforeShow</code>
and <code>onBeforeDestroy</code> can be overwritten to inject custom stuff there.</li>
<li>Behaviors can also define <code>triggers</code>, have access to the view&#39;s <code>$</code>, <code>$el</code> and <code>el</code> and event to the view itself using <code>this.view</code>.</li>
<li>Even more, they can have its own <code>ui</code> hash. And of course, they can listen to events emitted by
the view&#39;s model (<code>modelEvents</code>) or its collection (<code>collectionEvents</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Behaviors are managed using the utility class <code>Marionette.Behaviors</code>. While it works well out of the box
you <strong>have to overwrite</strong> at least the function <code>Marionette.Behaviors.behaviorsLookup</code> that is supposed to
return the datastore with behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="the-fading-example">The fading example</h2>
<p>Enough theory, let&#39;s write an example.
I will use a global variable as behavior store (I would not recommend that for production), so the first step is
to create that variable and make sure Marionette can find our Behaviors.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffee">_bh = {}
Marionette.Behaviors.behaviorsLookup = -&gt; _bh
</code></pre>
<p>(Yes, that is CoffeeScript)</p>
<p>Now, let&#39;s implement the behavior that does the fading animation</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffee">class _bh.FadingBehavior extends Marionette.Behavior
    defaults:
        duration: 200

    onFadeIn: (def) -&gt;
        @$el.animate opacity:1, @options.duration, def?.resolve

    onFadeOut: (def) -&gt;
        @$el.animate opacity:0, @options.duration, def?.resolve

    onRender: () -&gt;
        @$el.css opacity:0
</code></pre>
<p>This snippet uses a cool feature of CoffeeScript: it creates a <em>class</em> that is
automatically added to <code>_bh</code>. It has a default animation <code>duration</code> of 200 ms
and overwrites the handler <code>onRender</code> invoked after the view&#39;s <code>render</code> function.
It also provides functions for the events <code>fade:in</code> and <code>fade:out</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we have the behavior that manages the fade effects and a way to export it
(<code>_bh</code> and <code>Marionette.Behaviors.behaviorsLookup</code>) we need to write views that use
this behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-view">The view</h2>
<p>The following view does nothing special but displaying text. In addition, it includes the
previously defined behavior that provides the fading functionality. It also overwrites the
default fading duration.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffee">class AwesomeView extends Marionette.ItemView
    template: _.template &#39;So awesome. Very view. Much fading&#39;

    behaviors:
        FadingBehavior:
            duration: 1500
</code></pre>
<p>That is all that has to be written to integrate a behavior into a view.
Let&#39;s add some boilerplate code to render the view.</p>
<h2 id="the-boilerplate">The boilerplate</h2>
<p>We will use a <code>Marionette.LayoutView</code> to add the view, fade it in and
display a message afterwards.</p>
<p>The layout for that:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffee">class Layout extends Marionette.LayoutView
    template: _.template &#39;&lt;main&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&#39;
    el: &#39;body&#39;
    regions:
        main: &#39;main&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>And the code that uses it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffee"># Action
layout = new Layout
view = new AwesomeView
def = $.Deferred()

layout.render()
layout.getRegion(&#39;main&#39;).show view

view.triggerMethod &#39;fade:in&#39;, def

def.done -&gt; layout.$el.find(&#39;footer&#39;).text &#39;View has been faded in&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to play around with this example you can find a working
<a href="http://jsbin.com/nurehu/1/edit?js,output">JSBin here</a>. It also uses
CoffeeScript.</p>
