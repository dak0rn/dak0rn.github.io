<p>The custom domain for this GitHub page is now online. <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is
used to connect the top level domain to the GitHub subdomain.</p>
<p>In addition, Cloudflare is used to provide an SSL tunnel with a valid signed
EV certificate, speed optimizations and caching. A page rule is used to automatically
forward visitors to the HTTPS version.</p>
<h2 id="how-to">How to</h2>
<p>Setting up a custom domain with Cloudflare is quite easy. Given you already have
a user page at <code>username.github.io</code> and a registered top level domain you just
have to do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Register a Cloudflare account</strong> on <a href="https://cloudflare.com">cloudflare.com</a> and
configure your domain there. (I had to confirm that name servers have been changed
before I could actually change them in my domain management console)</li>
<li><strong>Change your domain settings</strong> by changing your domain&#39;s name servers to the two
name servers provided by Cloudflare. I had to wait about 24 hours before the name
servers were updated.</li>
<li><strong>Configure your domain</strong> on Cloudflare. I had to choose <em>Flexible SSL</em> to
setup a correct encrypted connection.</li>
<li><strong>Add a page rule</strong> to forward your visitors to SSL. Open the Page Rules site,
add the URL <code>*yourdomain.tld*</code> and choose <em>Always use HTTPS</em> (<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168306-Is-there-a-tutorial-for-Page-Rules-">see here</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Configure your repo</strong> by adding a file named <code>CNAME</code> that contains only
the top level domain (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/">see here</a>).</li>
</ol>
