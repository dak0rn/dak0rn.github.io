<p>vim is an awesome editor especially for developers like me. I
use it every day for nearly everything I have to edit.
By default, it is not possible to open files from the Finder on
OS X in a terminal vim session.</p>
<p>However, given that <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm</a> is installed, a simple
AppleScript can do the trick.</p>
<p>Open <em>Automator</em>, create a new application and add a <em>Run AppleScript</em> node.
Paste the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-applescript">on run {input, parameters}
    if (count of input) &gt; 0 then
        tell application &quot;System Events&quot;
            set runs to false
            try
                set p to application process &quot;iTerm&quot;
                set runs to true
            end try
        end tell
        tell application &quot;iTerm&quot;
            activate
            if (count of terminals) = 0 then
                set t to (make new terminal)
            else
                set t to current terminal
            end if
            tell t
                tell (make new session at the end of sessions)
                    exec command (&quot;vim \&quot;&quot; &amp; POSIX path of first item of input as text) &amp; &quot;\&quot;&quot;
                end tell
                if not runs then
                    terminate first session
                end if
            end tell
        end tell
    end if
end run
</code></pre>
<p>Save the project as an Application and choose it when opening files.</p>
