<p>Woohoo, the website has been updated.</p>
<p>Actually, I restructured the complete code base. The site still runs on
Backbone and Marionette supported by jQuery and underscore. I removed require.js
and moved the complete code to a single file.</p>
<p>Articles are written in Markdown with front-matter meta data, transformed to
HTML using Grunt and a couple of plugins and referenced in a JSON file.</p>
<p>That file is loaded dynamically using Backbone and rendered on the page.
The project page uses the GitHub API to obtain a list of non-forked projects
and lists them.</p>
<p>Want to see code? <a href="/app.js">Come get some</a>.</p>
